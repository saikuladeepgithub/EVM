# EVM
This repository contains a Python program that simulates the functioning of an Electronic Voting Machine (EVM). The evm.py file implements a basic EVM class that allows users to cast votes for multiple candidates and displays the voting results.
# Features
* Simulates the process of casting votes for a specified number of candidates.
* Tracks the total number of votes cast and the votes received by each candidate.
* Calculates the voting percentage and displays the results.
# Usage
 1) Clone the repository to your local machine.
 2) Run the evm.py file using Python to simulate the EVM.
 3) Follow the on-screen instructions to cast votes and view the results.
Feel free to contribute to this project by adding more features or improving the existing functionality.
